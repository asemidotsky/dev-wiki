## Personal routine

* Don't use work day for housework and activities not related to the work.
* Get up early enough to shower, get dressed for success, and eat a filling breakfast just like you would if you were working from the office.
* Set boundaries. Determine work hours for yourself and let your manager and team know when you will be available. Try to avoid working outside of these hours.
* Schedule small breaks throughout the day, including a time for lunch, and put them on your calendar before you start your workday.
* Set weekly goals, a list of deliverables, and share them with your manager and team. At the end of the week, check in to assess your performance.

## Communications

* Communicate with your manager, team and colleagues often
* Share project updates
* Set up a virtual “coffee corner” with your colleagues. Put 15 minutes on a coworker’s calendar to hop on a video call to catch up.
* Use webcam whenever possible to create a more human connection
* Use Microsoft Teams ‘blur my background’ function to protect personal privacy

Schedule calls to collaborate, make important decisions as a team, or to brainstorm, but be intentional with your time.

### Meetings

* Have a designated moderator
* Pause between people speaking to avoid talking over others.
* Don’t multi-task during meetings — video will help you focus your attention
* Mute your mic when you’re not speaking to avoid distracting background noise, echoes or feedback
* Monitor the meeting chat for people who may have questions, documents/links to share, or may be experiencing technical difficulties
* Always keep shared screen with the document/diagram/notes that contains the subject of discussion and make changes in it immediately to reflect participants ideas, comments, etc:
* Share an agenda ahead of time with clear goals
* Make sure you’re not wasting time. Scheduling calls for just 20 mins instead of 30 mins may help you make the most of the time you have
* Agree upon action times and deliverables before ending the call
* Include agenda and link to materials into meeting invitation - this will let participants prepare for it.
* Send prepared questions to participants prior to call (targeting particular participants with particular areas: solution architecture, infrastructure, requirements, UI/UX, etc).
* Thoroughly select participants. Using RACI terms: Involve only responsible and accountable customer representatives/colleagues.
* Keep links to shared resources in single and simple place in order to simplify access of involved participants;
* Direct discussions and keep participants focused on the subject and agenda;
* Moderate participants and always displace side topics to separate meetings to be conducted later (make notes to not forget and schedule them);
